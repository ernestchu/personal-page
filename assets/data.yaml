bios:
  - I am an Research Assistant in CITI at Academia Sinica studying computer vision,
    generative models and AI, under the supervision of Professor
    <a href="https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/pullpull/index_en.html" target="_blank">Jun-Cheng Chen</a>.
    I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from
    National Sun Yat-sen University, where I got my start on research working with Professor
    <a href="http://slpl.cse.nsysu.edu.tw/cpchen/" target="_blank">Chia-Ping Chen</a>.

  - My primary interest lies in machine learning and generative 
    models. I'm currently working on video generation using
    image Diffusion Models. (Last updated on June 1, 2023)

  - Before join CITI, I also worked part-time at
    the Office of International Affairs, NSYSU as a full stack
    Web developer. I develop Web applications for exchange programs
    mostly using PHP, Express, Vue, and maintaining all websites across
    the OIA office.

  - I've also involved in subjects such as,
    <a href="https://ernestchu.github.io/cse410-introduction-to-computer-graphics/Assignments/" target="_blank">computer graphics</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ernestchu/ftp-program-with-data-compression" target="_blank">socket programming</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ernestchu/on-line-chatting-service/tree/abe" target="_blank">attribute-based encryption</a>,
    <a href="https://ernestchu.github.io/mis588-data-visualization/" target="_blank">data visualization</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ernestchu/java-compiler-front-end" target="_blank">compiler design</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/ernestchu/nsysu-captcha-solver" target="_blank">chrome extension development</a> during my undergraduate study.

  - title: License Plate Verification and Warning System
    descriptions:
      - Use ML-based object detection technology to track the license plate.
      - The barrier gate is no longer needed as the system can detect moving target.
      - All of the inferences can be done on end-device, for example Jetson Nano.
